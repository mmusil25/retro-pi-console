## Abstract

It has always been a goal of mine to build the classic Raspberry Pi console emulator. It's a fun exercise in using the popular linux hardware platform. My roommate really wants a retro console so the situation alligned just right for me to be able to build it. 

In this README I will detail how I planned and executed the project.
